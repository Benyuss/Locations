# Locations

That program can calculate the distance between two locations (defined by coordinates-lon+lat-) (one given by user + a lot which can be read from a CSV file).
It's based on the haversine formula.

Program can generate geohash of these locations.
Every location (including the one which given by user) has a radius too.
It's used to know the user-given location is including the ones from the file or not(including these radius of course).

I'm a beginner Java-dev, it's just a training code.
